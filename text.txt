## Theory
1. What is the difference between URL and URI?
A URL is a specific type of URI that provides a way to 
locate a resource on the internet. It consists of the protocol 
(such as HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name or IP address, and the path, 
query parameters, and fragment identifier.

A URI is a string of characters that identifies
 or names a resource, but it may not provide the exact 
 location of that resource. A URI can be used to identify 
 various types of resources, including web pages, files, people, concepts, or abstract ideas.

2. What is the difference between the absolute path and the relative path?
 An absolute path provides the complete and exact location of a resource 
 starting from the root directory of the website or the server. It includes 
 all the necessary information to locate the resource, such as the protocol 
 (http:// or https://), domain name, subdirectories, and the file name. 
 Absolute paths are typically used when linking to external resources or 
 when the resource is located in a different domain or website.

 Whereas a relative path specifies the location of a resource relative to the current 
 location of the HTML file or the current directory. It indicates the path from the 
 current directory to the resource, without explicitly mentioning the root directory or 
 the domain. Relative paths are commonly used when linking to internal resources within 
 the same website or when the resource is located in a subdirectory of the current directory.
3. What is the HTTP request and response?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for communication between a client 
(such as a web browser) and a server over the internet. When a client wants to retrieve a 
resource (e.g., a web page, an image, or data) from a server, it initiates an HTTP request. 
The server, in turn, responds to the client's request with an HTTP response.
